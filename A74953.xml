         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood and its Miniſtry ſtands within, and conſiſteth of the inward work; and <hi>Paul</hi> who was made a Miniſter of the Spirit, which is within, he ſaid, <hi>VVork out your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and tremh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, 2 Cor. 5. 6. Phil.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>The firſt Prieſthood being made in the time of the Oath, under which Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood the ſwearing is upheld, and the people continue in the ſwearing and in he ſtrife.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood is made with the Oath, the confirmation thereof is the end of all ſtrife, debate and diſſention, and the end of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168449:2"/> the luſt from whence the wars, fightings, and vain janglings doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe; and the confirmation of this Oath, and the ſecond Miniſtry, which is confirmed by this Oath, puts an end to all Oaths and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Word of the Oath being come, and become fleſh, which Word was before the Oath, and the world, and ſince the Law, which Word maketh the Son, who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all, Heb. 6. 15. 16, &amp; Heb. 7. 20. Matt. 5. 34. Jam.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
            <p>The firſt Prieſthood and its Miniſtry under the firſt Covenant had a command to receive tythes of the people, yet they were not to ſue people at the Law if they did not bring the tythes, but were to receive the tythes and offrings, when they were brought their command was to receive them; and theſe tythes were given unto the ſtranger, unto the fatherleſs, and to the widow, that they might eat and be filled, as well as the Levite and the Prieſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 12, 13.

            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood and its Miniſtry is of the New Covenant, where the Law is changed, by which the firſt is made; and this is not of the world, neither upheld nor maintained by the things of the world, neither is made by a carnal Commandment, but by the power of an endleſs life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. &amp; 16.</p>
            <p>The firſt Prieſthood is after the fleſh, where the luſts are not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, whence the wars and fightings comes, where the likeneſſes are found among ſuch as are not come to the ſubſtance, for <hi>Abraham</hi> came from the wars, and gave the tenth of the ſpoyles unto him who was made like unto the ſon of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>Geneſis</hi> 14. 18.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood (who is of the Spirit, who comes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> according to the fleſh) is the Power of God, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the former likeneſſes; which ſubſtance being come, it puts an end to the wars, and ſo an end to the ſpoylings, and alſo an end to all that which cauſeth the ſpoyles, and if ſo, then an end to that of which tythes were firſt given; and ſo the ſubſtance of the likeneſſes being come, the Bleſſing is received in him, and the multiplyings known, and the increaſes of God witneſſed, and the ſpoyles divided at home, the ſtrong man being bound, and his Goods ſpoyled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23, 24. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Colloſſians</hi> 2. 17 18, 19.</p>

            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood is of the New Covenant, which is written in the Tables of the heart by a Mediator of a better covenant, in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168449:2"/> which Covenant there is a coming to be preſented perfect in the head, unto which, by the Miniſtry of the word of life, they come to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
            <p>The firſt Prieſthood ſtands in divers waſhings and carnal Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, until the time of reformation, until which time the outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances yet ſtandeth, and the outſide Worſhips yet are, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being daily performed, yet the daily comers to theſe Ordinances are not made perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood is eternal, purging the conſcience from dead works, whereby alſo the ſpirit of truth is received, and ſo the worſhip in ſpirit and in truth is known, which worſhip the Lord delighteth in; and ſuch ſeek the Lord and find him, and he is merciful to their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and their ſin he remembers no more, but they are blotted out as a thick Cloud; and ſo being made free from ſin, and become the ſervants of Righteouſneſs, then fruit and ſervice is brought forth and performed unto God, well pleaſing in his ſight, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22.</p>
            <p>The firſt Prieſthood ſtands in divers and carnal Offrings for ſin, and confeſſions of ſin Morning and Evening, and yet the ſin not taken away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. &amp; 11.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood ſtands in one offring for ſin, whereby the ſin is taken away, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 1. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 2. &amp; 7. &amp; 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 17.</p>
            <p>Under the firſt Prieſthood the vail is over the heart, and they that are there cannot ſee to him that is the end of the Law, who is made under the Law, to redeem them that are under the Law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Under the ſecond Prieſthood the vail is rent, and the broken heart is known, with whom God is; and ſo him that is entered within the vail is ſeen, even him that is the end of the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20.</p>
            <p>The firſt Prieſthood hath the Shewbread, which the carnal eye may ſee, and the natural man perceive; and ſo the Worſhip ſtands in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, in ſome form and place where the life is not, and ſuch may worſhip they know not what, being not come to the truth which makes free to worſhip in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1, 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 22.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Prieſthood hath the bread of Life which comes down from Heaven and gives life; the which bread being not in outward ſhew, was not onely hid from the Scribes and Phariſees who had the Oracles of God outwardly, but alſo from them that profeſſeth Chriſt without them only, for there is a time wherein Chriſt is known after the fleſh, or without, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that is with you, ſhall he in you, Ioh. 14. 17.

               </gap>nd his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony comes to be broken down, and the Fountain of living Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies opened, and the ſeed refreſhed with the hidden <hi>Manna;</hi> ſo the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> comes to be raiſed up through the vail by the power of him who is the living Miniſter within the vail, made under the Law, to redeem the ſeed from under the Law; and ſo as this is read in the work of it, and ſo felt and underſtood, the promiſe of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, under the Miniſtry of the ſecond Prieſthood, is witneſſed, even as it is written, I <hi>will dwell in them, and walk in them, and</hi> I <hi>will be their God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16 <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>Heh.</hi> 8. 8. to the end. <hi>Heh.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 15.</p>
            <p>In the time of the firſt Prieſthood there is much talking of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and many are pleading from the Letter for the Ordinances, which ſay they are to laſt for ever (as circumciſion was) and alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are crying, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, and yet the Temple is made [by ſuch] a den of Thieves, and a habitation of Dragons, and wild ſubtile devouring beaſts of the field, who have ſtollen up another way (in the Serpents wiſdom) then by Chriſt the Light and the Door, and ſo reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, being yet in their ſins, and their faith vain, and their minds and their conſciences being defiled, and they not come to the Doctrine of Repentance, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains being not level'd, and the burning Light not felt, nor the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not yet found, nor the way opened for the Seed, neither yet him ſeen that takes away the ſin of the world; and yet ſuch are crying The Ordinances, The Ordinances, and the Commands, which ſay they are to laſt to the end of the world, and yet they themſelves not come to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168449:4"/> the beginning of the world, nor to feel the power of the Word ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Light from the Darkneſs, nor yet to feel the entrance into the true circumciſion; and ſo the vail remains over the heart that they cannot ſee to the end of the commands, figures, and Ordinances, which are a ſhadow of good things to come, but the end and ſubltance is Chriſt, the light, life, and cornerſtone at which they ſtumble, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>In the time of the ſecond Prieſthood the Kingdom is witneſſed, which is not in words, but in power, where the proud boaſters are ſhut out, and thk unclean enters not, nor the vain janglers, who comes with their carnal weapons from the Letter without, to fight againſt the Lamb, whoſe commands are written in the heart, where the Holy Ghoſt is by ſuch reſiſted, who are not come to the ſecond Miniſtry, where all things are compleat in him who is the head, the beginning and the end, in whom the circumciſion made without hands is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed; ſo the vail is taken off the heart, and the end is ſeen, even he he that takes away the ſin of the world; and ſo all Treſpaſſes comes to be forgiven unto them that are buried in the baptiſm; and ſo dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, whereby alſo the hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us comes to be blotted out, and nayled down to the croſs, whereby the Principalities and Powers are ſpoyled by the Power of the Word that becomes fleſh, whereby thoſe things that were in ſhew are triumphed over, and nayled down to the croſs, through which the Life comes to be raiſed, and ſo Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God comes to be revealed and made manifeſt, being quickned in the ſpirit, and ſo no more to know Chriſt after the fleſh, but in that which is raiſed up through the croſs, unto which the ſhews and ſhadows of things are nailed down; ſo the Doctrines of Baptiſm and Repentance from dead works are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and thoſe things that are left behind are forgotten, and there is a preſſing forwards to perfection by the Miniſtry of the ſecond Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, wherein every man is to be preſented perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, in whom there is a growing from grace to grace, and a changing from glory to glory by the ſame ſpirit, having received of his fulneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>In the time of the firſt Prieſthood the patterns of the heavenly things are purified with the outward blood, the tranſgreſſion being without, and the Law without; and ſo here is the outward waſhings with the outward water, and the ſet-dayes of Purification; and theſe things were to be done often becauſe of the continual tranſgreſſion of that Law which ſtood without, which comes to be fulfilled, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſatiſfied by that without, and ſo the patterns of things in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens comes to be purified with theſe outward waſhings, and outward ſprinklings; and did not Chriſt Jeſus ſuffer without the gate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>Col.</hi> 2 23. and the Law being without hath the ſhadow, and yet not the Image, therefore far ſhort of Chriſt the ſubſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:168449:4"/>
            <p>In the time of the ſecond Prieſthood, the heavenly things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are purified with better ſacrifices then theſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 33. which ſerved to the purifying of the patterns, and the heavenly things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being purified with the living ſacrifice; ſo the way into the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all is known which is not manifeſted under the firſt Prieſthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 8. and ſo there is an entrance made into the believers reſt <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3. &amp; 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. where the ſeed of Abraham ſits down in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kingdome, which conſiſteth of righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Rom. 14. 17. and ſo as there is a coming to feel the power of the ſecond Miniſtery preaching to the ſpirit in priſon, 1 Pet. 3. 19. 1 Cor. 1. 24. and ſo to quicken them that were dead in ſin, Eph. 2. 1. by whoſe quickning power the ſeed comes to be raiſed up, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Chriſt the head, who ſits at the Fathers right hand in the heavenly places, Eph. 1. 20 which are purified and prepared for the faithful, who comes to ſit down with Chriſt in the heavenly places, Eph. 2. 5, 6. John 17. 21, 22, 23, 24. And as the heavenly things of the heavenly places are purified, and the entrance into the reſt miniſtred, ſo Chriſt comes to be ſeen exalted at the Fathers right hand in the heavenly places above all principalities and powers, (which are ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) being the head over all things, Eph. 1. 21, 22. And ſo there is a ruling over all that which ſtands in outward ſhow, the which Chriſt made a ſhow of openly, triumphing over them in it, Col. 2. 15. and if there be a triumphing over theſe things which are in ſhow, before the entrance into the holyeſt of all be made, how much more are the outward ſhowes triumphed over, and the principalities ſpoiled, when the way into the holieſt of all is made manifeſt by the power of him who is gone into the heavens, and is on the right hand of God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Authorities, and Powers being made ſubject unto him, 1 Pet. 3. 22.</p>
            <p>In the time of the firſt Prieſthood the rule is without, and ſuch as are there reſiſt the Spirit within, yet profeſs the Scriptures without, and not reſiſt them, but reſiſt the inſpiration which gave them forth, and yet are zealous for their rule without, being yet blinde like Saul, even perſecuting them in whom the Spirit of Truth bares rule, which Spirit they being not come unto, (to open the eye, and lead them into all truth,) are found out of their rule which they ſo much talk of, read and ſee James 1. 26. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Tit. 3. 9. Eph. 4. 29. 30, 31, 32. Eph. 5. 11. 1 Joh.. 3. 4. 1 Joh. 2. 4. Joh. 12. 36. Matth. 5. 28, 29. 30. and 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44.
